# Abstract
The advent of blockchain has revolutionized the finance and investment sectors. NFTs are the hottest trend in the cryptocurrency space. By the end of 2020, the total value of NFTs sold in the top five marketplaces is around $52,293,650. Decentralized finance platforms are blending towards NFTs as well. Understanding the need of the hour, Artemis establishes itself as a social media platform that brings together creators, collectors, fans, and influencers. Artemis becomes the global NFT marketplace where the members can create, collect, and discover NFTs across the globe. Interoperability is the need of the hour and this is what makes concepts like Polkadots successful.
Artemis's idea of NFT search engines that run seamlessly across multiple distributed ledgers will undoubtedly get skyrocketed. Decentralization is the key element of Artemis that allows creators and collectors to interact directly enabling the peer-to-peer trading of NFTs. The social media content platform is decentralized and no single authority governs it, giving no room for intermediaries and third-party payment processors.
NFT creators can have their profiles hosted on the Artemis Vision social media platform that exhibit themself as highly paid freelancers
